Port by agg23. Core by Ludvig Strigeus, sorgelig, greyrogue, Kitrinx, paulb-nl, and many others.

Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), referred to as the Famicom in Japan was the first major home console produced by Nintendo. This console made gaming a household name, and is still popular to this day

Core supports 4 controllers (when connected to the Dock), cartridge saves, and most mappers. Please report all issues to agg23, as most likely any issues experienced are issues with the port, not the core.
